## File System Usage

### Supported Operations
The filesystem supports all standard file operations:

```rust
// Directory operations
list_directory("/")                    // List root directory
create_directory("/documents")         // Create new directory
delete_directory("/old_folder")        // Delete empty directory

// File operations  
create_file("/hello.txt", b"Hello!")   // Create file with content
read_file("/hello.txt")                // Read file content
write_file("/hello.txt", b"Updated!")  // Update file content
delete_file("/hello.txt")              // Delete file

// Path operations
path_exists("/documents")              // Check if path exists
is_file("/hello.txt")                  // Check if path is a file
find_file("/documents/readme.txt")     // Find specific file
```

### File System Features

### File Manager Application
The built-in File Manager provides a graphical interface for file operations:
- Browse directories
- Create new files and folders with keyboard input
- Delete selected files and folders with confirmation
- Navigate directory hierarchy with breadcrumb navigation
- View file sizes with intelligent formatting
- Double-click files to open with appropriate applications
